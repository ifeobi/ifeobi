- 👋 Hi, I’m @ifeobi and I'm from Nigeria
- 👀 I’m a lawyer transitioning into the tech space. So, I am open to truckloads of advice.
- 🌱 I’ve learned HTML, CSS and JS and currently learning MongoDB (thereafter Node.js and React).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project at all that fits into what I have learned or what can expand my knowledge.
